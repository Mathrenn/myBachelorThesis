abstract="Predicting the next activity of a running execution trace of a business process represents a challenging task in process mining. The problem has been already tackled by using different machine learning approaches. Among them, deep artificial neural networks architectures suited for sequential data, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), recently achieved the state of the art results. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures can outperform RNNs on tasks for sequence modeling, such as machine translation. In this paper we investigate the use of stacked inception CNN modules for the next-activity prediction problem. The proposed neural network architecture leads to better results when compared to RNNs architectures both in terms of computational efficiency and prediction accuracy on different real-world datasets.",

abstract="Process mining techniques are able to extract knowledge from event logs commonly available in today's information systems. These techniques provide new means to discover, monitor, and improve processes in a variety of application domains. There are two main drivers for the growing interest in process mining. On the one hand, more and more events are being recorded, thus, providing detailed information about the history of processes. On the other hand, there is a need to improve and support business processes in competitive and rapidly changing environments. This manifesto is created by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining and aims to promote the topic of process mining. Moreover, by defining a set of guiding principles and listing important challenges, this manifesto hopes to serve as a guide for software developers, scientists, consultants, business managers, and end-users. The goal is to increase the maturity of process mining as a new tool to improve the (re)design, control, and support of operational business processes.",
